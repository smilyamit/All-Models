#1 In ANN
# In Adding the input layer and the first hidden layer
classifier.add(Dense(units = 6, kernel_initializer = 'uniform', activation = 'relu', input_dim = 11))
* that units = 6 is for hidden layer. ie (input+output)/2 = (11+1)/2 =6

# In ResNet-50
Identity block are the skip-connected block
Convolutional/Residual block are the normal block
