How hierarchical clustering is used?
Hierarchical clustering starts by treating each observation as a separate cluster.
Then, it repeatedly executes the following two steps: (1) identify the two clusters that are closest together, and (2) merge the two most similar clusters.
his iterative process continues until all the clusters are merged together.

When would you use K means cluster and when would you use hierarchical cluster?
A hierarchical clustering is a set of nested clusters that are arranged as a tree. K Means clustering is found to work well when the structure of
the clusters is hyper spherical (like circle in 2D, sphere in 3D). Hierarchical clustering don't work as well as, k means when the shape of the clusters is hyper spherical
